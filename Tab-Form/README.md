# Project Overview:
### Requirements : 

The problem statement included three tabs: Profile, Interest, setting with the specific field requirement like: 

Age Field : Only allowed numeric value 
Email Field : Validation to ensure the correct format

I had to incorporate dropdowns , radio buttons, checkboxes and implement : 

1. Validation for mandetory fields.
2. Data persistend accross tabs.
3. A Submit button that submitted the form appear only on the last tabs

This coding challenges not only tested my coding skills on React js but also led to a discussion on scalibilty and  maintainibilty.

Create a form configuration object to dynamically generate the form, sparking a discussion about. 

<h4>Scalibility</h4> - how easily the form could be extended or modified without rewriting significant portion of code 

<h4>Maintanibility</h4> - how moduler, readable and organized code is crucial for large team and long term project
